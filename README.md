This Python Code was my attempt at coding Boids 

The code includes the basic movement and vector calculations for the boid's three aspects: alignment, cohesion, and separation. 
The code also includes ways to make basic obsticals, have the boids follow or flee a target point, go through checkpoints and have basic pathfinding. 
The code uses pygame to set up the environment.
